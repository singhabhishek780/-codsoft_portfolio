                <p>I am a 19+ year old beginner web developer with science background. I love to spend my free time playing with codes at my home</p>
                <p>I'm highly energetic and self motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team.I work as college representative for two years and also worked as volunteer in my college in Freshers 2023.
                     I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high
                    precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating
                    on detailed work like programming or designing. </p>
